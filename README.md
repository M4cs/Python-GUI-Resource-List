  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <h4 align="center">This repository is a directory of a bunch of Python GUI libraries that you can use. I made it in response to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/amuww8/meta_can_we_have_a_moratorium_on_all_gui_posts/">thread I saw on r/Python</a> which brought up some valid points in that there are way to many questions about what GUI library to use. This will be a list that any developers of any skillset can come to and find information about what GUI library best suits their needs.</h4>
  <h2>Contributing</h2>
